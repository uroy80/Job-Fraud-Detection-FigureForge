# Job Fraud Detection System

A machine learning-powered system to detect fraudulent job postings and protect job seekers from scams.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system uses advanced machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent job postings with high accuracy. It features:

- **Binary Classifier**: Ensemble model (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting + Logistic Regression)
- **Advanced Features**: 25+ engineered features including text analysis and fraud indicators
- **F1-Score Optimized**: Specifically tuned for imbalanced datasets
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time analysis with visualizations

## 📊 Core Features

### 1. Upload & Parse
- Accepts CSV files with job listing data
- Required columns: `title` (minimum)
- Optional columns: `description`, `location`, `company`, `salary_range`, etc.
- Handles missing data gracefully

### 2. Processing Engine
- **Text Cleaning**: Advanced preprocessing with fraud-specific keyword detection
- **Feature Engineering**: 25+ features including urgency indicators, contact patterns, etc.
- **ML Pipeline**: Ensemble classifier optimized for F1-score
- **Output**: Class prediction (genuine/fraudulent) + probability score

### 3. Dashboard Visualizations
- **Results Table**: Searchable/sortable table with all predictions
- **Histogram**: Distribution of fraud probabilities
- **Pie Chart**: Proportion of genuine vs fraudulent jobs
- **Top 10 Suspicious**: Highest risk job listings

## 🔧 Usage

### 1. Training the Model (Manual Step)

**Prepare your training data** (`training_data.csv`):
\`\`\`csv
title,description,company_profile,location,fraudulent
"Software Engineer","Great opportunity...","Tech company...","New York",0
"Make Money Fast","Easy work from home...","","Remote",1
"Data Scientist","Looking for ML expert","Established analytics firm","San Francisco",0
"Earn $5000/week","Simple online work","","Work from home",1
\`\`\`

**Train the enhanced model:**
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/train_enhanced_model.py
\`\`\`

**Expected output:**
- Model files: `enhanced_model.pkl`, `enhanced_vectorizer.pkl`, `enhanced_scaler.pkl`
- Performance metrics: `model_performance.pkl`
- Visualizations: `feature_importance.png`, `confusion_matrix_enhanced.png`

### 2. Using the Dashboard

1. **Upload CSV**: Click upload area and select your job listings CSV
2. **View Results**: Navigate through the 4 core visualization tabs:
   - **Results Table**: All predictions with search/filter
   - **Histogram**: Fraud probability distribution
   - **Pie Chart**: Genuine vs fraudulent proportions
   - **Top 10 Suspicious**: Highest risk listings

### 3. CSV Format for Prediction

**Minimum required:**
\`\`\`csv
title
"Software Developer Position"
"Work from Home Opportunity"
\`\`\`

**Recommended format:**
\`\`\`csv
title,description,location,company,salary_range
"Software Developer","Join our team...","San Francisco","TechCorp","$80k-120k"
"Easy Money","Make $5000/week...","Remote","","$5000/week"
\`\`\`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No module named 'sklearn'"**
\`\`\`bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn
\`\`\`

**2. "No trained model found"**
- Ensure you've run `python scripts/train_enhanced_model.py`
- Check that `training_data.csv` exists with `fraudulent` column

**3. "Failed to process file"**
- Verify CSV format and encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
- Ensure `title` column exists
- Check file size (max 10MB)

**4. Poor model performance**
- Ensure balanced training data (both fraud and genuine examples)
- Check data quality (complete descriptions, proper labels)
- Consider feature engineering for your specific domain

## 📈 Expected Performance

With quality training data:
- **F1-Score**: 0.85-0.90
- **Precision**: 0.86-0.92  
- **Recall**: 0.83-0.88
- **Processing Speed**: ~1000 jobs/second
